# scikit-learn


The scikit-learn code examples cover a wide range of machine learning topics, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Here is a brief overview of the main categories of examples available on the scikit-learn website:

1. Classification: These examples demonstrate how to build and evaluate models for classifying data into two or more categories.

2. Regression: These examples demonstrate how to build and evaluate models for predicting a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables.

3. Clustering: These examples demonstrate how to group similar data points together based on their similarities or distances to each other.

4. Dimensionality reduction: These examples demonstrate how to reduce the number of input features or variables in order to simplify the modeling process or improve model performance.

5. Model selection: These examples demonstrate how to select the best model or set of hyperparameters for a given machine learning problem.

6. Feature selection: These examples demonstrate how to select the most relevant features or variables for a given machine learning problem in order to improve model performance or reduce overfitting.

7. Preprocessing: These examples demonstrate how to preprocess raw data in order to prepare it for use in machine learning models, including data cleaning, normalization, and transformation.


8. Model evaluation: These examples demonstrate how to evaluate the performance of machine learning models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
